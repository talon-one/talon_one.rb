#Talon.One API

#Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to manage applications and campaigns:  - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api) are used to integrate with our platform - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to manage applications and campaigns.  ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints  The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment. For example, if you access the Campaign Manager at `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerSessionV2](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint is `https://yourbaseurl.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`

  # Import customers into loyalty tiers
  # Upload a CSV file containing existing customers to be assigned to existing tiers.

The CSV file should contain the following columns: - &#x60;subledgerid&#x60; (optional): The ID of the subledger. If this field is empty, the main ledger will be used. - &#x60;customerprofileid&#x60;: The integration ID of the customer profile to whom the tier should be assigned. - &#x60;tiername&#x60;: The name of an existing tier to assign to the customer. - &#x60;expirydate&#x60;: The expiration date of the tier when the tier is reevaluated. It should be a future date.  About customer assignment to a tier: - If the customer isn&#39;t already in a tier, the customer is assigned to the specified tier during the tier import. - If the customer is already in the tier that&#39;s specified in the CSV file, only the expiration date is updated.  **Note:** We recommend not using this endpoint to update the tier of a customer. To update a customer&#39;s tier, you can [add](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/addLoyaltyPoints) or [deduct](/management-api#tag/Loyalty/operation/removeLoyaltyPoints) their loyalty points.

  # unit tests for import_loyalty_points
  # Import loyalty points
  # Upload a CSV file containing the loyalty points you want to import into a given loyalty program. Send the file as multipart data.  Depending on the type of loyalty program, you can import points into a given customer profile or loyalty card.  The CSV file contains the following columns:  - &#x60;customerprofileid&#x60; (optional): For profile-based loyalty programs, the integration ID of the customer profile where the loyalty points are imported.    **Note**: If the customer profile does not exist, it will be created. The profile will not be visible in any Application   until a session or profile update is received for that profile. - &#x60;identifier&#x60; (optional): For card-based loyalty programs, the identifier of the loyalty card where the loyalty points are imported. - &#x60;amount&#x60;: The amount of points to award to the customer profile. - &#x60;startdate&#x60; (optional): The earliest date when the points can be redeemed. The points are &#x60;active&#x60; from this date until the expiration date.    **Note**: It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string or string &#x60;immediate&#x60;. Empty or missing values are considered &#x60;immediate&#x60;. - &#x60;expirydate&#x60; (optional): The latest date when the points can be redeemed. The points are &#x60;expired&#x60; after this date.    **Note**: It must be an RFC3339 timestamp string or string &#x60;unlimited&#x60;. Empty or missing values are considered &#x60;unlimited&#x60;. - &#x60;subledgerid&#x60; (optional): The ID of the subledger that should received the points. - &#x60;reason&#x60; (optional): The reason why these points are awarded.  You can use the time zone of your choice. It is converted to UTC internally by Talon.One.  **Note:** For existing customer profiles and loyalty cards, the imported points are added to any previous active or pending points, depending on the value provided for &#x60;startdate&#x60;. If &#x60;startdate&#x60; matches the current date, the imported points are _active_.

For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)   called &#x60;provider&#x60; associated with the giveaway entity, the object in the CSV file, when opened in a text editor, must be: &#x60;\&quot;{\&quot;provider\&quot;: \&quot;myPartnerCompany\&quot;}\&quot;&#x60;.
