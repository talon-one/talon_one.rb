#Talon.One API

#Use the Talon.One API to integrate with your application and to manage applications and campaigns:  - Use the operations in the [Integration API section](#integration-api) are used to integrate with our platform - Use the operation in the [Management API section](#management-api) to manage applications and campaigns.  ## Determining the base URL of the endpoints  The API is available at the same hostname as your Campaign Manager deployment. For example, if you are reading this page at `https://mycompany.talon.one/docs/api/`, the URL for the [updateCustomerSession](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api/#operation/updateCustomerSessionV2) endpoint is `https://mycompany.talon.one/v2/customer_sessions/{Id}`

  # Import coupons via CSV file
  # Upload a CSV file containing the coupons that should be created. The file should be sent as multipart data.  The CSV file can contain the following columns:  - &#x60;value&#x60; (required): The coupon code. - &#x60;expirydate&#x60;: The end date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period. - &#x60;startdate&#x60;: The start date in RFC3339 of the code redemption period. - &#x60;limitval&#x60;: The maximum amount of redemptions of this code. For unlimited redemptions, use &#x60;0&#x60;. Defaults to &#x60;1&#x60; when not provided. - &#x60;attributes&#x60;: A json object describing _custom_ referral attribute names and their values. Double the double-quotes in the object. - &#x60;discountlimit&#x60;: The amount of discounts that can be given with this coupon code.   For example, if you created a [custom attribute](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/attributes#custom-attributes)   called &#x60;category&#x60; associated to the coupon entity, set it with &#x60;\&quot;{\&quot;\&quot;category\&quot;\&quot;: \&quot;\&quot;10_off\&quot;\&quot;}\&quot;&#x60;.  **Important:** Do not leave empty columns in the file.
